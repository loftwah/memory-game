# Memory Game

*A classic game to test your memory. Flip two cards at a time and remember the cards you've seen before.*

## Things to customize
- 🐮 Replace all the images with your own
    * [Open configuration](#~/.koji/images.json!visual)
- 💅 Change the background and colors of the cards
    * [Open configuration](#~/.koji/style.json!visual)
- ⚙️ Add your Google Analytics ID and Open Graph information for sharing
    * [Open configuration](#~/.koji/metadata.json!visual)

When you're ready, [deploy your project](#~/.koji/deploy.json!visual) and share it with the world! If you decide you want to change something later, you can always redeploy to update!

## Code structure
You can find the code for the main game board [here](#~/frontend/pages/GamePage/index.js).
